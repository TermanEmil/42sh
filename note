The project doesn't memory leak, but it's not written by all normes.
I think some normes are ridiculos:
	- no empty newline in a function.
		This just help to keep the code cleaner.
	
	- no do-while or for loop.
		Do I really need to add 4 extra lines to keep the code, "simplier"?
		I think using these extra loops keeps the code more intuitive.

I did my best to respect 5 functions in a file and no functions longer than 25 lines.
I do have 2-3 defines on multiple lines.
